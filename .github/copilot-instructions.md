## Quick orientation

This is a small, static responsive photo gallery (Lens by HTML5 UP). Key entry points:

- `index.html` — site entry and canonical thumbnail markup (`#thumbnails` section).
- `assets/sass/` — source styles (Sass). Primary import is `assets/sass/main.scss`.
- `assets/css/main.css` — compiled CSS used by the site (do not edit this file for source changes).
- `assets/js/main.js` — gallery behavior (viewer, keyboard shortcuts, touch gestures).
- `images/fulls/` and `images/thumbs/` — full-size images and thumbnails.

## Big-picture architecture and why it matters

- Static site with a JS-powered "viewer" that is dynamically created on page load (see `main.js:initViewer`).
- Styling is authored in Sass (`assets/sass/`) and compiled to `assets/css/main.css`. The SASS structure uses a small libs folder (`assets/sass/libs/`) for variables, durations and breakpoints which must remain in sync with JS settings.
- `index.html` contains the thumbnail markup; the viewer is not present in HTML and is injected by JS. Therefore changes to slide markup should follow the thumbnail pattern described below.

## Files and conventions to know (specific examples)

- Thumbnail markup (add new images by example in `index.html`):

  <article>
    <a class="thumbnail" href="images/fulls/01.jpg" data-position="top center">
      <img src="images/thumbs/01.jpg" alt="" />
    </a>
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Description</p>
  </article>

  - `href` points to the full image in `images/fulls/`.
  - `data-position` (optional) maps to CSS `background-position` for how the full image is framed in the viewer.

- Styling sync points (edit in SASS, then recompile):

  - `assets/sass/libs/_vars.scss` defines `$misc` and `$duration` maps. Example keys you may change:
    - `$misc: ( main-side: right, thumbnails-per-row: 2 )`
    - `$duration: ( slide: 0.5s, layout: 0.75s )`

  - `assets/js/main.js` contains matching settings near the top of the file (comments indicate which values must match SASS):
    - `settings.thumbnailsPerRow` ↔ `$misc.thumbnails-per-row`
    - `settings.mainSide` ↔ `$misc.main-side`
    - `settings.slideDuration` ↔ `$duration.slide`
    - `settings.layoutDuration` ↔ `$duration.layout`

  Keep these values consistent — otherwise timing/layout or thumbnail grid logic may appear broken.

## Build & developer workflow (minimal, discoverable)

- The repo contains precompiled CSS at `assets/css/main.css`. To make style edits, change SASS files under `assets/sass/` and recompile into that file.

- Reasonable local commands (assumption: no build tool chain present in repo). If you have the Dart Sass CLI installed, a simple compile command is:

  ```bash
  # From repo root
  sass assets/sass/main.scss assets/css/main.css --no-source-map --style=expanded
  ```

- To preview the site locally (static server):

  ```bash
  # from repo root (Python 3 available)
  python -m http.server 8000
  # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
  ```

If your environment uses a different SASS tool (gulp/webpack/VS Code extension), use that instead. Tell me which you prefer and I can adapt these instructions.

## JavaScript and runtime notes

- `assets/js/main.js` expects jQuery and supporting utilities; `index.html` loads files in this order: `jquery.min.js`, `browser.min.js`, `breakpoints.min.js`, `main.js`. Keep that order.
- Touch and keyboard shortcuts are implemented in `main.js`. Many UI behaviors are gated by breakpoints (see `assets/sass/libs/_breakpoints.scss` and `assets/js/breakpoints.min.js`).

## Common small tasks and where to do them

- Add/remove photo: edit `index.html` - add an `<article>` with `.thumbnail` anchor linking to files in `images/fulls/` and `images/thumbs/`.
- Change gallery side or thumbnails-per-row: edit `assets/sass/libs/_vars.scss` (change `main-side` or `thumbnails-per-row`) AND update the corresponding values at the top of `assets/js/main.js` to match.
- Tweak animation timing: update `$duration` in `_vars.scss` and the `settings` durations in `main.js`.

## Patterns agents should follow when editing

- Prefer editing SASS (source) not `assets/css/main.css` (compiled). If you must edit `main.css`, note that changes will be overwritten the next time SASS is compiled.
- When changing layout/timing variables, update both Sass and JS matching settings in the same PR and reference both files in the commit message.
- Preserve markup patterns in `index.html` for thumbnails — the JS parses `.thumbnail` anchors; altering structure may break viewer creation.

## Integration & dependencies

- jQuery is a runtime dependency (`assets/js/jquery.min.js`). The gallery relies on `breakpoints.min.js` and `browser.min.js` shipped under `assets/js/`.
- No build/CI files were found in the repository root; if you add a build system, document new commands in this file.
